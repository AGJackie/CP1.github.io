    Book value
    <div id="content">
      The book value of an asset is the price originally paid at the date of purchase.
      <br>
      Advantages
      <ul>
        <li>objective
        </li>
        <li> conservative (for assets expected to rise in value over time … e.g. equities, property)
        </li>
        <li>easily understood
        </li>
        <li>often used in company accounts (e.g. for fixed assets)
        </li>
      </ul>
      Disadvantages
      <ul>
        <li>easily manipulated (simply by selling and re-buying)
        </li>
        <li>can be very different from current market value (so of limited use in deciding on whether asset is currently cheap or dear)
        </li>
        <li>no corresponding method for valuing liabilities.
        </li>
      </ul>

    Written-up book value
    <div id="content">
      Historic book value adjusted periodically for changes in value.
      But, introduces some subjectivity without addressing any of the fundamental problems with book value itself.

  <div class="column middle" id="pagebutton">
    Market value
    <div id="content">
      Represents the price at which the asset can be bought (or sold) in the open market. the mid-market price is often used (the mid price between bid price and offer price)
      <br />
      Advantages
      <ul>
        <li>
          objective
        </li>
        <li>easily understood
        </li>
        <li>readily available (for many assets)
        </li>
        <li>reflects the price at which the asset can currently be bought (or sold)
        </li>
      </ul>
      Disadvantages
      <ul>
        <li>
          it can fluctuate wildly in the short term, which not reflect changes in the expected future proceeds.
          a very different valuation result may be obtained depending on the exact date of the valuation …
          which may not reflect any real change in the ability to meet the promised liabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          can be difficult to value liabilities consistently as there is usually no corresponding market for liabilities
        </li>
        <li>
           not available for all assets e.g. property, unquoted shares
        </li>
        <li>
          cannot be easily used to assess whether the asset is currently cheap or dear
        </li>
        <li>
          A smoothed market value may be used to reduce the impact of short-term volatility (e.g. an average of the market value over the last month).
          <br />
          However, this introduces an element of subjectivity into the valuation method and makes
          it even more difficult to value the liabilities consistently (as the appropriate discount
          rate for valuing the liabilities cannot be readily determined).
