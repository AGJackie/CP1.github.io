      Overview
    <div id="content">
      The company will wish to invest in assets that match the nature, term and currency of the liabilities.
      <br />
      minimises the risk of insolvency as a result of adverse investment experience … since a change in the value of the liabilities (e.g. due to a rise in salary inflation or a fall in interest rates) should be reflected by a corresponding change in the value of the assets held to meet these liabilities.
      <br />
      Alternatively, a financial institution may choose not to match the assets and liabilities.
      The aim here would be to increase the investment return achieved by holding a mismatched position.
      A higher investment return would then lead to greater profits …
      which could be used to pay higher dividends to shareholders, to pay higher bonuses to with-profits policyholders or
      to reduce future contributions to a pension scheme for the sponsor and/or scheme members.
      However, in this case, it is crucial that the financial institution holds additional capital
      (known as free assets) to provide a cushion against adverse market movements (that will not necessarily be matched by
      a corresponding change in the value of the liabilities faced).

    Nature

     <ul>
       <li>
         Discuss the nature of assets and liabilities.
       </li>
       <li>Salary growth will often exceed price inflation.
       </li>
       <li>For <span class="highlight"> fixed liabilities </span> , immunisation could be used to minimise the investment risk faced, but this is subject to theoretical and practical problems

    Duration
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>in practice, it may be difficult to find assets that match the duration of the liability outgo.
        </li>
        <li>Timing of outgos is uncertain (so liquidity of assets also important).
        </li>
        <li>If the liabilities are of short term, it would also be appropriate to hold a small proportion of the assets in cash (or shorter-dated bonds) to match the liabilities arising. Liquidity requirement
        </li>
        <li>For annuity, term is equal to expectation of life (so match with assets of similar term).

    Other considerations
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>reinvestment risk, as future premiums invested on unknown terms
        </li>
        <li>when matching the asset and liability cash flows, an appropriate allowance for future mortality should be made to determine the expected liability outgo in each future time period

    Immunisation
    <div id="content">
      requirements
      <ol>
        <li>The present value of liabilities equals the present value of assets
        </li>
        <li>The duration of liabilities equals the duration of the assets.
        </li>
        <li>The convexity of the assets is higher than that of the liabilities
        </li>
      </ol>
      Limitations
      <ul>
        <li>Applies to small changes in interest rates;
        </li>
        <li>Applies to uniform changes in interest rates;
        </li>
        <li>Immunised portfolio changes continuously;
        </li>
        <li> Immunises against profit (precludes policy switching). It removes the possibility of potential gain.
        </li>
        <li>It is often difficult to find bond portfolios to match very long duration liabilities.
        </li>
        <li>The theory is aimed at fixed money liabilities of fixed timing. It cannot be applied in any straightforward way to liabilities that are linked to salary / index.

    Active management versus negative management
    <div id="content">
      Advantages of active management
      <ul>
        <li>It is expected to obtain higher rate of returns through active management through buy under-priced assets and sell over-priced ones if the market is not efficient.
        </li>
        <li>If the negative portfolio management is applied, chosen index may perform badly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Disadvantages
      <ul>
        <li>Higher dealing cost due to frequent trades.
        </li>
        <li>The salary for the fund manager could be high.
        </li>
        <li>It brings in new risk: the fund manager could make false decisions. The fund may underperform the index.
