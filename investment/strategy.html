      Overview
    <div id="content">
      The company will wish to invest in assets that match the nature, term and currency of the liabilities.
      <br />
      minimises the risk of insolvency as a result of adverse investment experience … since a change in the value of the liabilities (e.g. due to a rise in salary inflation or a fall in interest rates) should be reflected by a corresponding change in the value of the assets held to meet these liabilities.
      <br />
      Alternatively, a financial institution may choose not to match the assets and liabilities.
      The aim here would be to increase the investment return achieved by holding a mismatched position.
      A higher investment return would then lead to greater profits …
      which could be used to pay higher dividends to shareholders, to pay higher bonuses to with-profits policyholders or
      to reduce future contributions to a pension scheme for the sponsor and/or scheme members.
      However, in this case, it is crucial that the financial institution holds additional capital
      (known as free assets) to provide a cushion against adverse market movements (that will not necessarily be matched by
      a corresponding change in the value of the liabilities faced).

         Discuss the nature of assets and liabilities.

    Duration
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>in practice, it may be difficult to find assets that match the duration of the liability outgo.
        </li>
        <li>Timing of outgos is uncertain (so liquidity of assets also important).
        </li>
        <li>If the liabilities are of short term, it would also be appropriate to hold a small proportion of the assets in cash (or shorter-dated bonds) to match the liabilities arising. Liquidity requirement
        </li>
        <li>For annuity, term is equal to expectation of life (so match with assets of similar term).

        <li>reinvestment risk, as future premiums invested on unknown terms
        </li>
        <li>when matching the asset and liability cash flows, an appropriate allowance for future mortality should be made to determine the expected liability outgo in each future time period

    Relative attractiveness of FIBs and ILBs
    <div id="content">
      Yields on FIBs will fall (and prices rise) if investors’ expectations of future inflation fall or if the size of the inflation risk premium falls. Either of these could occur with minimal impact on real yields (and, thus, on prices of ILBs). Thus, an investor whose expectations of future inflation are lower than the market expectations (as given by the difference between real yields and nominal yields) will find FIBs more attractive than ILBs (as, if correct, yields on FIBs should fall after purchase).
      <br>
      Why might expectations of future inflation fall?
      <br>
      (real) short-term interest rates are expected to rise (e.g. perhaps due to a change in government and/or government policy) .
       Why might the size of the inflation risk premium fall?
       <br>
      IRP is compensation for uncertainty regarding future inflation … so, a fall in IRP implies that future inflation is less uncertain without necessarily being higher or lower … however, usually, less uncertainty would be accompanied by a fall in general inflation levels.
      Conversely, the price of ILBs will rise (and real yields fall) as markets become more uncertain about the prospects for future inflation. Greater uncertainty about future inflation will lead to an increase in demand for securities that protect investors against unexpected inflation.
      ILBs protect policyholders from unexpected inflation.
      <br>
      The main economic circumstances that tend to cause greater uncertainty over expected future inflation are:
      <ul>
        <li> less government commitment to a low inflation environment
        </li>
        <li> loose monetary policy
        </li>
        <li> devaluation of domestic currency
        </li>
        <li> rapid economic growth
        </li>

    Immunisation
    <div id="content">
      requirements
      <ol>
        <li>The present value of liabilities equals the present value of assets
        </li>
        <li>The duration of liabilities equals the duration of the assets.
        </li>
        <li>The convexity of the assets is higher than that of the liabilities
        </li>
      </ol>
      Limitations
      <ul>
        <li>Applies to small changes in interest rates;
        </li>
        <li>Applies to uniform changes in interest rates;
        </li>
        <li>Immunised portfolio changes continuously;
        </li>
        <li> Immunises against profit (precludes policy switching). It removes the possibility of potential gain.
        </li>
        <li>It is often difficult to find bond portfolios to match very long duration liabilities.
        </li>
        <li>The theory is aimed at fixed money liabilities of fixed timing. It cannot be applied in any straightforward way to liabilities that are linked to salary / index.

    Active management versus negative management
    <div id="content">
      Advantages of active management
      <ul>
        <li>It is expected to obtain higher rate of returns through active management through buy under-priced assets and sell over-priced ones if the market is not efficient.
        </li>
        <li>If the negative portfolio management is applied, chosen index may perform badly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Disadvantages
      <ul>
        <li>Higher dealing cost due to frequent trades.
        </li>
        <li>The salary for the fund manager could be high.
        </li>
        <li>It brings in new risk: the fund manager could make false decisions. The fund may underperform the index.
