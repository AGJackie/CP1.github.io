  <h1>Explanations of the yield curve</h1>

<div class="column side">
Three theories explaining the upward slope of yield curve are:
<ul>
  <li> Expectation theory
  </li>
  <li> Market segmentation theory
  </li>
  <li> Liquidity preference theory
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="column middle" id="pagebutton">
    Expectation theory
    <div id="content">
      The expectations theory suggests that the market expects future short-term interest rates to rise, thereby meaning that long-term interest rates (which can be replicated by a series of short term investments) are higher than current short-term interest rates and, hence, the yield curve slopes upwards.

  </div>

  <div class="column middle" id="pagebutton">
    Market segmentation theory
    <div id="content">
      Market segmentation theory suggests that demand at different terms comes largely from investors with liabilities of that term.
      <br>
      As a result, there is often a natural lack of demand for medium-dated bonds
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="column middle" id="pagebutton">
    Liquidity preference theory
    <div id="content">
      The liquidity preference theory contends that, as short-term bonds have a more stable market value than long-term bonds, the yield on long-term bonds should be (slightly) higher to compensate for the extra volatility
