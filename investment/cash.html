      <ul>
        <li> To meet short term liabilities.
        </li>
        <li>institutions with uncertain liability outgo (e.g. non-life insurance companies) may hold more cash to meet unexpected payments
        </li>
        <li>after receipt of a large cash inflow (e.g. a transfer value for a pension scheme), cash may be held whilst the suitability of other investments is considered
        </li>
        <li>maintaining a liquid base allows an investor to take part in investment opportunities that may arise from time to time
         </li>

      Short- term tactical reasons
      <div id="content">
        <ul>
          <li>rising short-term interest rates will tend to depress both bond and equity markets
          </li>
          <li>start of an economic recession
          </li>
          <li> likely to lead to a fall in equity markets and, perhaps, also a rise in government borrowing -> falling bond price
          </li>
          <li>depreciation of domestic currency
          </li>
          <li>makes overseas cash investments more attractive
          </li>
          <li>also, domestic interest rates may be raised to defend currency
