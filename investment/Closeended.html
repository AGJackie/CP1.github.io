    Introduction
    <div id="content">
      closed-ended, where the total number of shares or units in the fund is fixed (Investment trusts);
      <ul>
        <li>approximation of the share price is given by the net asset value (NAV) per share … which is the value of the company’s assets divided by the number of shares. In practice, though, shares in most investment trust companies are lower than the NAV per share.
        </li>
        <li>he difference between the actual share price and the NAV per share is a source of extra volatility in the return on investment trusts (compared with unit trusts).
        </li>
      </ul>
       open-ended, where the fund manager can create or cancel units as new money is invested or disinvested.
       <br>
       Not subject to company law. Instead, the trustees (e.g. an insurance company or bank) will ensure that the managers of the fund obey the trust deed and rules (and operate for the benefit of unit holders).

    Advantages of close-ended fund
    <div id="content">

        <li>expected return will usually be higher (as a result of gearing)
        </li>
        <li>discount to NAV means that exposure to underlying assets can often be bought at below market value
        </li>
        <li>management charges tend to be lower than for unit trusts
        </li>
        <li>wider range of assets are usually available to closed-ended funds (which can increase expected returns further)
        </li>
