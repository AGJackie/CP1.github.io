  <h1>Contract design for pension schemes</h1>

<div class="column side">
In designing the pension schemes, one must consider:
<ul>
  <li>
    The needs of pensioners
  </li>
  <li>
    The expenses asscociated with running the scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether to choose DB or DC plan.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="column middle" >

    <div id="content">
      One of the key requirements of good design is that they meet the
      needs of members, in particular with regard to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a pension at retirement – how much depends on the extent of State provision
        </li>
        <li>
          death-in-service benefits – important for members with young families
        </li>
        <li>
          incapacity benefits – most important for onerous occupations
        </li>
        <li>
          medical expenses – how important depends on the quality of State provision
        </li>
        <li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column middle" >
    Expenses
    <div id="content">
      However, as well as the cost of the benefits, the employer must
      also consider the expenses associated with setting up and running
      a pension scheme.
      <ul>
        <li>
          legal, actuarial and consultancy services
        </li>
        <li>
          investment expenses
        </li>
        <li>
          communication to members – members must be provided
          with full information on joining the scheme and with regular
          benefit statements thereafter
        </li>
        <li>
          compliance – with regard to regular actuarial valuations and accounting requirements
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column middle" >
    Key features of defined benefit scheme
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          members get defined benefits, based on formulae set out in
          the scheme rules
        </li>
        <li>
          employer bears risk of adverse experience (particularly with
          regard to investment and longevity) and, thus, future cost to
          employer is uncertain
        </li>
        <li>
          fixed expenses of running scheme are relatively high (as
          regular actuarial valuations are required, as well as other
          specialist expertise – e.g. legal, investment)
        </li>
        <li>
          final-salary schemes favour employees with high salary
          growth who remain in scheme until retirement
        </li>
        <li>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="column middle" >
        Key features of defined contribution scheme
        <div id="content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              members get unpredictable benefits in retirement, and are subject to investment and annuity risk
            </li>
            <li>
              employer contribution is a defined percentage of salary
            </li>
            <li>
              fixed expenses of running scheme are low, but individual
              per-member expenses can be high (depending on
              investment strategy chosen)
            </li>
            <li>
              defined contribution schemes provide a more generous benefit to early leavers, and thus can be more flexible
            </li>
          </ul>
