      Cope with capital strain
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          The company should model the capital it requires for a variety of different new
           business assumptions and, if necessary, explore the possible routes for attracting new
            capital (e.g. from shareholders, from issuing debt, from a parent company etc).
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, it could also consider financial reinsurance.
        </li>

          pay lower commission → less incentive to sell → lower business volumes
        </li>
        <li>
          less underwriting → worsening mortality experience → losses and/or higher premiums.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce guarantee
        </li>
        <li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ask some professionals in a particular area to better understand the risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          introducing reviewable premiums
        </li>
        <li>
          Prudent assumption
          <br>
          Higher margins can be built into the assumptions to reflect the uncertainty regarding
          future experience (but, this is likely to adversely affect competitiveness).
        </li>
        <li>
          Limit the critical illnesses covered to the standard definitions used by other companies.
        </li>
        <li>
          bonus rate can be adjusted to reflect actual experience.
          profits from one source can be used to offset losses elsewhere.
          BUT, need to consider impact on PRE and on new business volumes.
        </li>
        <li>
          offer the contract as an additional ‘rider’ benefit only, rather than as a stand-alone contract
          （reduce the risk of anti-selection）
        </li>
        <li>
          introducing some risk sharing (e.g. by means of a significant excess) to ensure that risks of anti‐selection and moral hazard are reduced.
        </li>
