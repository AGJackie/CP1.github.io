    Advantages of Defined contribution scheme
    <div id="content">
      Flexibility + Transparency
      <br />
      Flexibility: Cater to personal circumstances (both the benefit type and the contribution level) + risk appetite
      <br />
    Transparency: turnover
    <ul>
      <li>
        The greater flexibility on retirement will allow the member to purchase an annuity that
        best reflects their individual circumstances (e.g. with regard to spouse’s pension, increases to
        pensions in payment, guarantee periods). Also, for individuals in poor health on retirement, it may be possible to purchase an impaired life
        annuity (or use the income drawdown approach), thereby receiving a higher level of pension
        income than would likely have been provided through the DB pension scheme.

      </li>
      <li>
        In addition, the DC pension scheme is likely to offer a range of investment opportunities prior to
        Retirement, so that the individual member can invest his/her own fund in a way that reflects
        their own risk appetite.
        And, the opportunity to purchase a with‐profit or unit‐linked annuity and/or an income drawdown
        product on retirement, allows the member to continue to share in investment performance after
        retirement too.

      </li>
      <li>
        Also, in most DC pension schemes, it will be possible for the member to vary the level of
        contribution payable in any given year to reflect current circumstances (e.g. if the member is
        recently married or has a young family, contributions can be temporarily reduced, and if the
        member has more disposable income or receives a one‐off bonus payment, a higher contribution
        can be made to the fund).

      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, DC pension plans are more portable and transparent when a member moves from one job to
        another.
        In a defined‐benefit pension scheme, the link between current salary and accrued pension is broken
        when the member leaves the company (and, as a result, the value of the accrued pension is
        usually much lower than if the member had remained in service). However, this is not the case
        in a DC pension scheme, as the accrued pension pot is (largely) unaffected by moving from one
        employer to another.
        Given that employment is much more transient nowadays, this greater flexibility and transparency
        may be welcomed by employees.

     Risks in defined benefit plan

    <div id="content">
      For members
      <ul>
        <li>The main risk for a member of a defined benefit pension scheme is that there
           are insufficient funds to meet the promised benefit.
           <ul>
             <li>
               This may be due to underfunding, insolvency of the provider or to an inappropriate investment strategy
             </li>
             <li>
               Possible reasons: actual experience worse than expected (particularly with regard to investment
               return, but also salary growth and mortality/longevity), employer did not (or was not able to)
               make contributions at the level recommended by the actuary
             </li>
           </ul>
          </li>
        <li>Another key risk faced by the member is the risk that promised benefit is changed.
          <ul>
            <li>
              In practice, legislation usually prevents a worsening of accrued benefits (unless the member agrees to it).
              The member might agree to change the benefit to avoid the company being insolvent.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, benefits relating to future service may be changed or terminated altogether (
              e.g. some defined benefit schemes have been closed with accrued benefits becoming a deferred
              pension and future benefits that are defined contribution in nature).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The member of a defined benefit pension scheme also faces the risk that inflation erodes
          the value of the pension in payment (unless inflation-proof increases are included).</li>
      </ul>
     For sponsors
     <ul>
       <li>
         In a defined benefit pension scheme, the main contribution risk
          is that the overall cost of the benefits is unaffordable.
          <ul>
            <li>
              This may be due to poor financial circumstances of the sponsor or simply that the costs have increased to such an extent that they have outweighed the benefits (to the sponsor of providing the scheme).
            </li>
          </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
         A further risk for the sponsor of a defined benefit scheme is the uncertainty of cost.
         <ul>
           <li>
             The total cost will not be known with certainty until all benefits have been provided and no future liabilities remain.
           </li>
           <li>
             However, the required contribution rate will fluctuate over time according to the actual experience since the previous valuation, creating uncertainty in long-term business planning.
           </li>
           <li>
             In particular, the funding level of the scheme may fall to an unacceptable level in times of recession
             (when the value of the scheme assets is likely to be fall). This, in turn, will require a higher
             contribution rate to be paid by the sponsor (and, indeed, may even require an immediate contribution
             to make good some of the deficit).
           </li>
           <li>
             However, the main problem here is that this payment is required at a time that the sponsor is least likely to be able to afford it.
           </li>
           <li>
             Risk mitigation method: pay more than is required when economy is performing well (within the maximum limits prescribed), retain investment surpluses within scheme to provide cushion (rather than using it to reduce current contributions and/or provide discretionary benefit increases).
           </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
         the expenses of operating a DB pension scheme are considerably higher than that of a DC scheme.
          particularly with regard to legal, actuarial and investment management costs.

    Reserves
    <div id="content">
      Reserve for: something has not occurred, incurred but not reported, outstanding claims, handle claims.
      <br />
      Because of the long‐term nature of most life insurance contracts, the main reserve required for an
      in‐force policy is an unexpired risk reserve (i.e. the EPV of future benefits and expenses minus
      the EPV of future premiums).
      <ul>
       <li>
         an outstanding claims reserve, which covers claims that the insurer has been notified of
        but which have not yet been settled
        <ul>
          <li>such settlement delays do not happen in life insurance, as the claim amount
          will usually be well defined and there will usually be little doubt about the validity of
          any claim made
          </li>
          <li>in many lines of non‐life insurance business, these reserves are estimated using
          statistical techniques (e.g. the chain ladder method)
          </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
      an incurred‐but‐not reported reserve, which covers that have occurred but have not
      yet been reported to the insurer
      <ul>
       <li>
       again, such delays in reporting are not significant in life insurances, as it is
      generally clear when a claim event has occurred (although this may be less clear‐cut
      for some critical illness contracts)
       </li>
     </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      an unexpired risk reserve
      <ul>
       <li>
      which, as in life insurance, relates to claims that may occur before the end of the
      period of cover
    </li>
    <li>
      however, unlike in life insurance, as most non‐life insurance contracts are short-term
      and the risk is (relatively) uniform over the term of the contract, this is
      usually taken simply as the portion of the original premium that relates to the period
      of cover remaining
      </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      a catastrophe reserve
        <br />
      designed to cover the extra risks arising from concentrations of claims (e.g. from a
      single weather event). This is also unlikely to be significantly for life insurance, where claims of
      individual policies can be considered to be largely independent from one another.
      </li>
      <li>
      a claims handling reserve
        <br />
      Due to the higher risk of unforeseen expenses due to legal actions and the greater costs of
      investigating potentially fraudulent claims, many lines of non‐life insurance business will also
      included a separate reserve in respect of claims handling expenses.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column middle" id="pagebutton">
    Investment
    <div id="content">
    For short tail business, the main investment consideration is liquidity.
    This will ensure that uncertain claims outgo can be met quickly. To this end, the company is likely to invest
    a large proportion of its assets in cash and short-dated government bonds.
      <br />
     long tail business will tend be riskier, as the claim amounts will usually be subject to more uncertainty
     (e.g. as a result of claims inflation, retrospective legislation etc).
      Long tail liability claims will likely be real in nature, requiring a small proportion
       of the assets to be held in equities (or other real assets).
